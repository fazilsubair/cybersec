# Needle in a Haystack

## Description

> You've obtained an ancient alien Datasphere, containing categorized and sorted recordings of every word in the forgotten intergalactic common language. Hidden within it is the password to a tomb, but the sphere has been worn with age and the search function no longer works, only playing random recordings. You don't have time to search through every recording - can you crack it open and extract the answer?

## Solution

Uses `time(0)` and `rand` and a big array of words. Used some chatGPT to convert code to python but then realised we can just break in GDB where the words are loaded and check the results, e.g.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
breakrva 0x224b
```
{% endcode %}

Then either print words and manually search:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
x/203s 0x555555557008
```
{% endcode %}

Alternatively, search with GDB:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
search "HTB"
Searching for value: 'HTB'
haystack        0x555555557418 'HTB{d1v1ng_1nt0_th3_d4tab4nk5}'
haystack        0x555555558418 'HTB{d1v1ng_1nt0_th3_d4tab4nk5}'
```
{% endcode %}

Flag: `HTB{d1v1ng_1nt0_th3_d4tab4nk5}`
