# Inspection

## Description

> Here's a freebie: the flag is ictf.

## Solution

As the title suggests, we can use the `inspector` (F12) and have a look around.

We'll quickly see the description HTML looks like this.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```html
<p m4rkdown_parser_fail_1a211b44="">Here's a freebie: the flag is ictf.</p>
```
{% endcode %}

We have our flag.

Flag: `ictf{m4rkdown_parser_fail_1a211b44}`
