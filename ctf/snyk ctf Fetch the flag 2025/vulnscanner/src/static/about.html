        <h2>What is VulnScanner?</h2>
        <p>VulnScanner is an open-source security testing tool that allows you to perform automated vulnerability checks
            on various services using customizable YAML templates. It is designed to be easy to use while also offering
            flexibility for more advanced use cases.</p>

        <h3>Core Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Template-Based Testing</strong>: Define checks for HTTP status codes, response bodies, headers,
                and more using simple YAML configuration files.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable</strong>: Create and upload your own templates, or use the pre-built ones to start
                testing immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Supports Multiple Services</strong>: VulnScanner can test services over HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and
                other protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source</strong>: VulnScanner is completely open-source, allowing you to contribute or
                modify it according to your needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <div class="callout warning">
            <strong>ðŸš¨ Warning:</strong> Do not ever execute untrusted and/or unreviewed templates. Thoroughly review
            any templates before running VulnScanner. Running untrusted templates could potentially lead to the
            execution of
            malicious code on your system, which may result in data loss, system compromise, or unintended consequences.
        </div>

        <p>All of <a href="/templates">our templates</a> are cryptographically signed and verified before they are made
            available for use. This ensures that only templates that have been properly vetted and signed by the
            VulnScanner
            project are uploaded and executed within the scanner.</p>

        <p>Hereâ€™s how the security of the templates works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryptographic Signing:</strong> Every template provided by the VulnScanner team is
                cryptographically
                signed and verified. This ensures that the templates cannot be tampered with or altered
                without
                invalidating the signature.</li>
            <li><strong>Signature Verification:</strong> When you run VulnScanner with a template, VulnScanner checks
                the
                signature of the template against a known list of valid signatures. This prevents any template with an
                invalid
                signature from being executed, ensuring the integrity of the template.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Execution Control:</strong> The <code>code</code> field in templates allows for server-side
                code
                execution, but only when the template passes all checks. This functionality is strictly controlled, and
                the
                templates on the site are reviewed to ensure they do not contain malicious or unsafe code.</li>
            <li><strong>Template Review Process:</strong> All templates made available on the site undergo a thorough
                review
                process to ensure they are safe to use and perform legitimate security checks. However, itâ€™s always
                important to
                independently verify any template you plan to run in your own environment. Please see our list of
                default templates and our list of known hashes for more information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Although we ensure that all templates published by the VulnScanner project are
            secure,
            itâ€™s crucial that you always verify any custom templates that you may create or download from external
            sources. If
            youâ€™re not sure about the templateâ€™s contents, itâ€™s best to review it thoroughly or run it in a safe,
            isolated
            environment first.</p>


        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a YAML-based template that defines the checks you want to perform.</li>
            <li>Upload the template to the server, where it will be executed against your specified services.</li>
            <li>The scanner will send requests and compare the responses against your templateâ€™s criteria, providing you
                with results.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>VulnScanner is built with flexibility and scalability in mind. Whether you're a developer, security
            researcher, or penetration tester, VulnScanner can be used in a variety of ways to automate and streamline
            your testing process.</p>
